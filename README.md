# neu_net
neu net is a very simple package in which I am working to practice what I have learned in the following course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning. It allows you to create and train any neural network that results from joining the following layers: dense, flatten, convolutional, dropout; with relu, sigmoid and tanh activation and softmax for classification.
